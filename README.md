# ToolsMc
ToolsMc is a powerful minecraft toolkit for servers and on the future for more things!

# How does it work?
ToolsMc is a Bash script that can download a server so you don't need to setup anything!

# Install 
To download ToolsMc run this code.
<br>
<code>. <(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebi-vscode2/ToolsMc/master/install.sh)</code>
<br>
the file will be downloaded in /usr/bin for compatibility purposes.

# Why there's only a folder for vanilla servers?
It's because minecraft only stores the latest version so if you want to play 1.19 when 1.20 is released you can`t download the file.
